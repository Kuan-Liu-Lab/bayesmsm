Description: Fitting Bayesian marginal structrual models to estimate average treatment effect for drawing causal inference with time-varying treatment assignment and confounding with extension to handle informative right-censoring. This package can be used for continuous or binary treatment assignments, covariates and end-of-study outcomes. Based on the Bayesian marginal structural models of Saarela et al (2015) <DOI: 10.1111/biom.12269> and Liu et al (2020) <DOI: 10.1177/0962280219900362>.
