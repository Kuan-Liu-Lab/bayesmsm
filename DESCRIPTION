Description: 
    Package for fitting Bayesian marginal structural models for estimating average treatment effect with longitudinal causal data with extension to handle informative right censoring. 
    This package can be used for continuous or binary end-of-study outcome and a time-varying binary treatment. 
    This method was originally described by Saarela, Stephens, Moodie, and Klein in Biometrics, 71(2), 279-288 <doi:10.1111/biom.12269>
