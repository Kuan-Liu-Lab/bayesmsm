Description: This package provides tools for estimating causal effects using Bayesian Marginal Structural Models. It includes functions for Bayesian non-parametric bootstrap to calculate causal effects and for plotting the average potential outcome (APO). The package aims to facilitate the analysis of observational data with time-varying treatments, providing a user-friendly software to Bayesian causal inference methods.
