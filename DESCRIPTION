Description: Fitting Bayesian marginal structrual models to estimate average treatment effect for drawing causal inference with time-varying treatment assignment and confoudning with extension to handle informative right-censoring. The Bayesian marginal structural models is a semi-parametric approach and features a two-step estimation process. The first step involves Bayesian parametric estimation of the time-varying treatment assignment models and the second step involves non-parametric Bayesian bootstrap to estimate the average treatment effect between two distinct treatment sequences of interest. Based on the Bayesian marginal structural models of Saarela et al (2015) <DOI: 10.1111/biom.12269> and Liu et al (2020) <DOI: 10.1177/0962280219900362>.
